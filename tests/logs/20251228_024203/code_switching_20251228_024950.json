The Arabic used was mostly natural and fluent, with a good use of Gulf/Saudi dialect, though there was a slight mix of English and Arabic that could have been more seamlessly integrated. Error handling was not explicitly tested as there were no unavailable items or misunderstandings, but the AI provided clear instructions for modifications or cancellations.
